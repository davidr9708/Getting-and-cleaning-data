Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of the three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 


These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

Time of accelerometer                        
Time of gravity accelerometer                 
Time of accelerometer jerk                     
Time of gyroscope                             
Time of gyroscope jerk                        
Frequency of accelerometer                    
Frequency of accelerometer jerk               
Frequency of gyroscope                        


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean: Mean value of the variable 
Mean X: Mean value in the X direction of the variable
Mean Y: Mean value in the Y direction of the variable
Mean Y: Mean value in the Y direction of the variable

Standard deviation: Standard deviation value of the variable
Standard deviation X: Standard deviation value in the X direction of the variable
Standard deviation Y: Standard deviation value in the Y direction of the variable
Standard deviation Z: Standard deviation value in the Z direction of the variable
